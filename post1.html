        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>So this is where my thoughts & musings on design go. However, at the time of writing this, I haven't done
            enough research or put some good thought and time into this assignment.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Yadda Yadda Yadda</h2>

          <p>I do know that I've come across several websites that need help. Unfortunately, for me, if a website has
            bad design I rarely go back to it and therefore don't think of it again as I'll find another site to answer
            my question in a manner that appeals to my learning style.</p>

          <p>This is probably where reading "Don't Make Me Think" comes into play and the whole point of this assignment
            ... </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reading Time</h2>

          <p>I have a 2-hour plane ride tomorrow morning so hopefully I can get some reading done and maybe take a few
            minutes during my weekend out of town to put down a few words and thoughts that relate to this assignment.
            But if not, well, come back next week when I've finally got my stuff together.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">April 16, 2019</h2>
          <p>I still do not have my stuff together but I did read the chapters! #winning #notexactly</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">April 22, 2019</h2>
          <p>My website of choosing is <a href="https://http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/" target="_blank">The Marine
              Mammal Center</a> in Sausalito, California. As a former volunteer and this being Earth Day, I thought it
            would be appropriate to discuss what this website gets right and where things could be better.</p>

          <p>The challenge here is how to incorporate a lot of information in one place and how to organize it
            accordingly. When you first land on the home page you're almost overwhelmed with text yet four large
            rotating pictures that almost seem unrelated - donation, volunteer, education, and environmental awareness.
            It's a lot to take in especially if your primary purpose of visiting is to see pictures of cute pinnipeds.
            And although the nav bar at the top has ten buttons (yes, <b>TEN</b>), it can be confusing if you're not
            sure where you're supposed to go.</p>

          <img src="img/TMMCnavbar.JPG">

          <p>The one thing about this website that I think could use some help is making the call to action to report
            animals in distress and the ask for donations could be a little more prominent. The phone number is listed
            but almost in a spot where I don't think I would look for it - in the upper right hand corner, next to the
            sign up for the email updates. As for the donation section, it is offset by a different color - orange. This
            is a good use of color in that orange and blue work well together as a color scheme but one would almost
            think to look for a larger and possibly green DONATE HERE button. But once you click the button, you are
            taken to a separate page where you can get your heartstrings tugged upon & the cute fuzzy faces of sea
            otters and in the background a young California sea lion is racing back to the ocean with the iconic Golden
            Gate Bridge as his backdrop.</p>

          <a href="https://secure3.convio.net/tmmc/site/Donation2?6183.donation=form1&df_id=6183&mfc_pref=T"
            target="_blank"><img src="img/TMMCdonate.JPG"></a>

          <p>What the website does right is give information and a lot of it. Being an animal rescue, hospital, and
            research facility all in one, there is so much science and data and Latin to be found on the pages. This is
            good especially if you're doing heavy research or looking to learn about TMMC and the work they do and have
            done. The text is clear and readable and makes use of the tried & true blue type to indicate links for more
            information. The fonts are simple and sans serif so that simplicity is achieved. The images are clear and
            high resolution so you don't mix up your <a
              href="http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-elephant-seal/"
              target="_blank">elephant seals</a> with your <a
              href="http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-fur-seal/"
              target="_blank">fur seals</a>.</p>

          <p>This website is good but it could be better. But given the amount of information presented here, how does
            one go about organizing so much data and all the resources without losing the message or possibly worse -
            losing the viewer? I think that is something most science and information-heavy websites are tasked and
            challenged with - being the top resource for their niche.</p>
