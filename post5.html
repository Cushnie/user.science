                    <p>If you're a Gen Xer or older, remember the first time you heard about <a href="https://www.booksontape.com/" target="_blank">Books On Tape</a>? The thought of being able to listen to the latest Tom Clancy or Leon Uris novel while sitting in your car or doing laundry was amazing! Multitasking at its finest! Now I, too, can talk about the latest and greatest novel on The New York Times Best Seller's List at this month's neighborhood dessert party. Or in my case, making those super long family road trips that rivaled the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085995/" target="_blank">Griswold's adventure to Wally World</a> just a little more bearable.</p>

                    <p>Fast forward to digital age and everything on the internet. We have put aside the books on tape and have gone back to reading the book - but this time on our Kindle while checking our emails, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and live tweeting about the weirdo on the bus all at the same time.</p>

                    <p>But what about those with sight impairments? How about hearing impairments?</p>

                    <p>For example, Instagram seems almost antithesis for someone who can't see well. And what about those Instagram stories with the cute little GIF that says "Sound On!" for those with a hearing issues?</p>

                    <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/WS4yjIO3q1eCE55Mra" width="240" height="223" frameBorder="5" class="giphy-embed"></iframe>

                    <p>It wasn't until I had a deaf roommate and used <a href="http://www.abouttty.com/" target="_blank">TTY</a> for communications. It was quite an experience to have someone read to you his messages that he's typing and then listen to the operator ask you to pause while she typed out your response. I like to think of it as early days of text messaging and the precursor to Blackberry. (If you must know it was 1997.) This made me realize how often I took my hearing for granted.</p>

                    <p>Then about 10 years later, my grnadmother started to lose her eyesight to macular degeneration. She was an avid reader and loved doing crossword puzzles but with her inability to see, how was she going to keep these things up? Enter the books on tape. (Amazing how what was old is now new!) She was luck to have a library with a very large selection of them and then soon companies like <a href="https://www.audible.com/" target="_blank">Audible</a> provided digital content.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally,
                        it is a
                        task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the
                        thrill of
                        just beginning.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally,
                        it is a
                        task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the
                        thrill of
                        just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
                        tomorrow.
                        Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too
                        little for the
                        next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is
                        a
                        historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human
                        development.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the
                        size of a
                        marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
                        fragile, so
                        delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has
                        to change a
                        man.</p>

                        that’s what

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year
                        mission: to
                        explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no
                        man has gone
                        before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a
                        fundamental truth
                        to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
