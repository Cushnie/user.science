                    <p>If you're a Gen Xer or older, remember the first time you heard about <a
                            href="https://www.booksontape.com/" target="_blank">Books On Tape</a>? The thought of being
                        able to listen to the latest Tom Clancy or Leon Uris novel while sitting in your car or doing
                        laundry was amazing! Multitasking at its finest! Now I, too, can talk about the latest and
                        greatest novel on The New York Times Best Seller's List at this month's neighborhood dessert
                        party. Or in my case, making those super long family road trips that rivaled the <a
                            href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085995/" target="_blank">Griswold's adventure to Wally
                            World</a> just a little more bearable.</p>

                    <p>Fast forward to digital age and everything on the internet. We have put aside the books on tape
                        and have gone back to reading the book - but this time on our Kindle while checking our emails,
                        Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and live tweeting about the weirdo on the bus all at the same
                        time.</p>

                    <p>But what about those with sight impairments? How about hearing impairments?</p>

                    <p>For example, Instagram seems almost antithesis for someone who can't see well. And what about
                        those Instagram stories with the cute little GIF that says "Sound On!" for those with a hearing
                        issues?</p>

                    <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/WS4yjIO3q1eCE55Mra" width="240" height="223" frameBorder="5"
                        class="giphy-embed"></iframe>

                    <p>It wasn't until I had a deaf roommate and used <a href="http://www.abouttty.com/"
                            target="_blank">TTY</a> for communications. It was quite an experience to have someone read
                        to you his messages that he's typing and then listen to the operator ask you to pause while she
                        typed out your response. I like to think of it as early days of text messaging and the precursor
                        to Blackberry. (If you must know it was 1997.) This made me realize how often I took my hearing
                        for granted.</p>

                    <p>Then about 10 years later, my grnadmother started to lose her eyesight to macular degeneration.
                        She was an avid reader and loved doing crossword puzzles but with her inability to see, how was
                        she going to keep these things up? Enter the books on tape. (Amazing how what was old is now
                        new!) She was luck to have a library with a very large selection of them and then soon companies
                        like <a href="https://www.audible.com/" target="_blank">Audible</a> provided digital content.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Enter the World of Regulations</h2>

                    <p>According to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1978, the progress of our technology was so
                        vast and grand and unanticipated, that they had to <a
                            href="https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies" target="_blank">amend the
                            section</a> to include ways of disseminating electronic information for those with
                        disabilities.</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
                        tomorrow.
                        Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too
                        little for the
                        next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>I think companies and technology providers have done a pretty good job so far to be able to
                        provide the information in an easy-to-use format. In this week's assignment we're introduced to
                        <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#devtools" target="_blank">Chrome's
                            Lighthouse</a> tool which allows you to audit a particular website for usability.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Kind of Audit You Actually Welcome</h2>

                    <p>Now let's look at a website. I will continue to use <a herf="http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/"
                            target="_blank">The Marine Mammal Center</a> as my test subject as I'm sure you haven't
                        tired yet of those cute fuzzy furry faces,</p>


                    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/harborseal.JPG" alt="Pacific Harbor Seal"
                        style="border:#000000 6px outset">

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Pacific Harbor Seal, <i>Phoca vitulina</i></span>

                    <p>So go to their page, and run Audits in the Developer Tools. Ouch. An accessibility score of
                        <b>58</b>. Yeah that kinda hurts. So let's see what happened. I'm only going to focus on 2
                        things - ARIA and contrast.</p>


                    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Wk5Audit.JPG" alt="Audit" style="border:#000000 6px outset">

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Screenshot of the website audit as done in Chrome
                        Lighthouse</i></span>

                    <p>ARIA - oof. Big fail here.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Wk5ARIA.JPG" alt="ARIA" style="border:#000000 6px outset">
                    <p>If the website slowed down the picture carousel and possibly decreased the number of menu items,
                        I wonder if some adaptive technologies could be used here. Even as one with decent vision and
                        hearing it's difficult to manage. And I've mentioned this before in a <a
                            href="post2.html">previous blog entry</a>. </p>
<p>Now let's talk about color contrast. Using blue on this page is almost a no-brainer. If you're an organization that does most of its work associated with the ocean then blue is the something everyone can get on board with. But with so many variations of blue, which ones works and what about the contrast color? Or how about, do we have to use it everywhere? Below is a screenshot of the comments from the audit.</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="img/Wk5Contrast.JPG" alt="Contrast" style="border:#000000 6px outset">

<span class="caption text-muted">Screenshot of the website audit as done in Chrome
    Lighthouse</i></span>
    <p>As you can see, the audit actually picks up on the code where improvements can be made. I think this is huge as it provides the developers, the coders, and the shareholders an opportunity to expand on their website without having expend too many resources.</p>
    <p>To be fair though, their primary focus is really on helping the animals as they are a working animal hospital. But with the need for financial help and volunteers, and their location in the San Francisco Bay Area with the likes of Google, Facebook, and Apple just a quick drive away, you'd almost think that they'd want to work on that appeal. I think if TMMC really does want to try something out and make a larger impact witih their website, it would benefit them to look at these recommendations and find small and easy ways to work them into their site.</p>
